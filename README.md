README:

PayOff is a stock price simulation game. The user enters the program in story mode. The user can move on by pressing the space bar or by simply waiting and then pressing the continue button. The user is taken to the starting screen where they can enter the next mode by pressing enter. They have no entered the main screen. Here, users can buy stocks by clicking on one of the panels that says “Enter stock here.” There is a day counter on the right hand side and the amount of cash on the left hand side. Once one has clicked on one of the panels, they can enter in a stock from the SP500. They can key-press enter to see a graph of the stock. They can also buy stock by keeping the stock inputted, pressing the buy button, entering in the amount wanted, and key-pressing enter. The same can be done for selling. For predict, the same procedure, except the user can enter in the amount of days in the future they want to predict. Pressing enter will show a RBF regression graph and closing that window will allow the user to see the predicted price. When the user goes back the main screen, if they have bought shares of that stock, it will show in their portfolio. Clicking on that stock will take the user to that respective stock home page. It will display stock information such as price, shares, and profit. The user is able to buy more stock, sell stock, and predict prices. Clicking the back button will take the user back to the main screen where they can buy more shares, sell shares, track progress, etc.
